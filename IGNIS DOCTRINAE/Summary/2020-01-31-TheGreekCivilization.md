## Summary

The Greek achievement—reason, freedom, humanism—was unquestionably of profound historical significance. Different to Mesopotamia and Egypt where people were subject to royal power originated with the gods, the Greeks first defined the individual by the capacity to reason. Seeing the state as a civilizing agent, they created both civic politics and political freedom. They made laws that served the common good and disputes to govern themselves, and regarded active participation in public affairs as a duty. The Greeks also gave to Western civilization a conception of inner, or ethical, freedom—to shape oneself, to develop into an autonomous and self-directed person. Underlying everything accomplished by the Greeks was humanist attitude toward life. A belief was expressed in the worth, significance, and dignity of the individual—the maximum cultivation of human talent, the full development of human personality, and the deliberate pursuit of excellence. Believing that human beings could master themselves, the Greek humanist had an aspiration to create a higher type of man that would mold himself according to worthy standards and make his life as harmonious and flawless as a work of art, although it may required effort, discipline, and intelligence. By discovering theoretical reason, by defining political freedom, and by affirming the worth and potential of human personality, the Greeks broke with the past and founded the rational and humanist tradition of the West.
